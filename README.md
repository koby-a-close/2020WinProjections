# 2020WinProjections


The goal of this project is to predict final win totals for all 30 MLB teams in 2020.

The files of interest in this repository are:

2020Wins_Projections_v2 --> updated to scale win predictions to 2430 total in the league
MLR_ModelBuilder_v1 --> function I created to perform RFE, parameter tuning, and final predictions

# 2020WinProjections


The goal of this project is to predict final win totals for all 30 MLB teams in 2020. I plan to use a number of different
model options including linear regression, decision trees, SVMs, etc. as well as varrying features.

I will compare results to over/under lines on sports betting platforms as well as historical performance of the model.
